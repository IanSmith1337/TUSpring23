# Linear Algebra Review

## Point

Described by color, position, velocity, etc. Usually in matrix form.

## Rigid Body

With change in speed of the points of an object, the object doesn't lose its form.

## Vectors

Written as either -> A, **A**, or using starting and ending points -> AB.

Contains direction and length.

No absolute starting position.

### Normalization

Magnitude = ((A))

Unit vectors = Magnitude of 1.

### Addition

Hypotenuse = addition of -> A and -> B.

In Cartesian Coords: Just add.

### Multiplication

#### Dot (scalar)

A • B = ((A))((B))cos(theta)

cos(theta) = (A•B)/((A))((B))

For Unit Vectors:

cos(theta) = A-hat • B-hat

##### Projection

project b = k • ahat

k = ((b->)) cos(theta)

#### Cross

A X B = -B X A

((A X B)) = ((A))((B))sin(theta)

Use right hand rule.

## Cartesian Coordinates

X and Y graph. Described as any orthogonal UNIT vector.

A= (x y)  
A^T = (x, y)  
((A)) = sqrt(x^2+y^2)
