## Important Stuff

She has some projects that need student assistanceâ€¦ maybe check with her?

This class is NOT about gaming, it's the precursor to it.

2D and 3D transforms  
Rasterization  
shading  
reflectance  
texture mapping  
geometric modelling  
ray tracing  
animation

This is pretty much the stuff behind Unity and Unreal engines.

No text required!

One week before finals week will be the final project showcase.

Submissions later than 5 minutes past due date will not be accepted.
